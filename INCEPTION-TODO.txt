Now:
- seasons/episodes in tv detail view controller
- watchlist bauen (model, shows, movies, airing calendar, add from searchviewcontroller, add from detailviewcontrollers)
- preferences(caching, image video, notifications,...)
- stats for watchlist f.e: watched.li
- if no picture: show placeholder-dark in knownFor
- see todos in code

Later:
- maybe use language parameter in api calls
- consider search/multi page to show all search results

- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- update localizable.strings and storyboard localizables
- implement 3d touch ?

- search keyboard is not dark

Now:
- watchlist:
	- Show:
		- create model
		- show->seasons->episodes navigation in watchlistviewcontroller
		- create coredatahelper for shows
		- add/remove from detailviewcontroller
		- add/remove from searchviewcontroller
	- WatchlistViewController
		- change watchlistviewcontroller to show movie and shows (segmented control)
		- add new entries from watchlistviewcontroller
		- load changes and update core data model (for shows => new episodes,seasons)

- preferences(caching, image and video quality, notifications,...)
- stats for watchlist f.e: watched.li

Later:
- update localizable.strings and storyboard localizables

To Consider:
- maybe use language parameter in api calls
- consider search/multi page to show all search results

- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- implement 3d touch ?

Now:
- make hit area bigger for seen button
- bug: empty season prevents from marking show as seen => also progress is wrong
To Consider:
- maybe use language parameter in api calls
- consider search/multi page to show all search results

- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- implement 3d touch
- delta load for tv show changes
- primary tint color in light theme might be not readable => change color
- progressbar for tv shows in watchlist does not look good on iPad => think of a better design
- tests
- fastlane (configure setup, create screenshots filled with data, etc.)
	- snapshots
		- searchresults
		- detailview of a movie
		- watchlist of a tv-show
		- statistic screen with values > 0
	- for every device in english and german

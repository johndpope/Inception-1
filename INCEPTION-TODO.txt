Now:
- build watchlist (model, shows, movies, airing calendar, add from searchviewcontroller, add from detailviewcontrollers(movie and episodeguide))
- preferences(caching, image and video quality, notifications,...)
- stats for watchlist f.e: watched.li

Later:
- update localizable.strings and storyboard localizables

To Consider:
- maybe use language parameter in api calls
- consider search/multi page to show all search results

- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- implement 3d touch ?

- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- implement 3d touch
- delta load for tv show changes
- primary tint color in light theme might be not readable => change color
- progressbar for tv shows in watchlist does not look good on iPad => think of a better design
- tests
- make use of the corespotlight api to make the app searchable through spotlight => search for movies, shows, persons etc and open them right in the app

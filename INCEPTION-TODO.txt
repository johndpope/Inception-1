Now:
- app icon : https://dribbble.com/shots/1989971-App-Icon
- readme (cocoapods, swiftlint, documentation, fastlane)
- tests
- fastlane (configure setup, create screenshots filled with data, etc.)
- refactoring

To Consider:
- maybe use language parameter in api calls
- consider search/multi page to show all search results
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28634995/chain-multiple-alamofire-requests
- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- implement 3d touch
- delta load for tv show changes
- primary tint color in light theme might be not readable => change color

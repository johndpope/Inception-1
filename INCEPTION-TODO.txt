Now:
- watchlist:
	- load changes and update core data model (for shows => new episodes,seasons)
	- calendar fix warnings and add landscape support

Later:
- update localizable.strings and storyboard localizables

To Consider:
- maybe use language parameter in api calls
- consider search/multi page to show all search results

- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- implement 3d touch ?

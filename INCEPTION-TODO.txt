Now:
- app icon : https://dribbble.com/shots/1989971-App-Icon
- readme (cocoapods, swiftlint, documentation)
- fastlane (screenshots, deployment, tests, signing, test coverage, linter)
- refactoring
- season navigator top and bottom padding (in episodeguide not correctly positioned and missing padding + watchlist correctly positionend but missing padding)
- flash episodes are not loading (see on iphone, also why not updating ?)
To Consider:
- maybe use language parameter in api calls
- consider search/multi page to show all search results

- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- implement 3d touch
- delta load for tv show changes
- primary tint color in light theme might be not readable => change color

Now:
- Themes
	- set all colors in all viewcontrollers when they are loaded + barStyle in app delegate for navigationbar and tabbar
- app icon : https://dribbble.com/shots/1989971-App-Icon

To Consider:
- maybe use language parameter in api calls
- consider search/multi page to show all search results

- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- implement 3d touch ?
- delta load for tv show changes

Now:
- make hit area bigger for seen button
- change from minutes to hour or days for stats bar chart when then numbers get too big
- make a faq section to describe the functionality better (especially for the calendar view)
- add functionality to mark a whole season as watched
- add unit to runtime information

To Consider:
- consider search/multi page to show all search results

- consider pages for discover categories (to show more results) (maybe different layout ?)
- implement 3d touch
- delta load for tv show changes
- primary tint color in light theme might be not readable => change color
- progressbar for tv shows in watchlist does not look good on iPad => think of a better design
- tests
- make use of the corespotlight api to make the app searchable through spotlight => search for movies, shows, persons etc and open them right in the app
